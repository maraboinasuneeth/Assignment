# Assignment
Below are the general coding principles I used for the solution and also in general that I used in my day to day work.
- Use consts for input arguments if you are not modifying them internally.
- Prefer using unordered_map compared to map since read operations of unordered_map are little bit faster.
- Check for nullptr before accessing any memory location
- Use modular approach with well defined , small and concreate APIs.
- Cheeck for boundaries of an array before accesing it.
- Writing unit tests for any features and taking test driven approach if possible.
